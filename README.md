# FlexibleCountModel
This repository provides the implementation of a flexible statistical model designed to handle count data with varying levels of zero inflation and outliers. The preprint can accessed by https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27365

To fit the Discrete Extended Generalized Pareto Distribution (DEGPD) and Zero-Inflated Discrete Extended Generalized Pareto Distribution (ZIDEGPD) models, as used in this study, you need to download the code from the "degpd-and-zidegpd" repository using this link:

# Real data
This study uses a real dataset from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD). Due to licensing restrictions, the data cannot be shared publicly. For more information or to access the GTD, please visit: https://www.start.umd.edu/using-gtd

The left figure shows a spatial map of the total number of fatalities in Afghanistan, including both locals and terrorists, aggregated by location. This visualization helps identify the regions most affected by violent incidents according to the Global Terrorism Database (GTD).

The figure on the right presents the frequency distribution of fatalities across all recorded events in the dataset. It illustrates how often different numbers of fatalities occur, highlighting patterns such as common low-fatality incidents and rare high-fatality events.

These figures together provide both geographical and statistical perspectives on the impact of terrorism in Afghanistan.
